  Your character advances in power by gaining experience.
  
  You gain experience by being part of a group that kills someone/something.
  
  You lose experience by dying or being decapitated.
  
  The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many 
  players are in your group; your size (total hps/mana/move){this is the main 
  factor}, your age, your status, how hard the mob is to kill, and some random
  variations.
