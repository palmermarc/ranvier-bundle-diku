  Syntax: hunt <mob>
  
  If you are in the same area as a mob you need to find, you can HUNT it down by
  using this command. It tells you the direction that the mob is in.
  Be careful because if you hunt a mob that is dead, you won't be able to find it, 
  and if you hunt a mob that is the same name as something else you will find it 
  hard to find the right one.
  
  HUNTING takes up a certain amount of MOVE every time you move it tells you which
  direction the mob is in.
  
  Use this skill wisely - it is not for those who don't understand it.
  
  To use this skill properly, you need to PRACTICE it.
  
  ***Players can NOT be hunted***
