  Syntax: cast clone
  
  CLONE is a spell that creates a clone of yourself. It will not have any of your
  equipment or the same attributes as you, just stand there and be you. It is
  useful if you are being hunted by another player(s) to fool them into thinking
  that you are somewhere you aren't, and faking your own death. You cannot create
  clones of other people.
