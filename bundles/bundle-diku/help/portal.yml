  Syntax: cast portal <victim>
  
  This spell creates a magical portal between the caster and the target. 
  The portal remains in existance for 2 or 3 hours (mud time), during which 
  time anyone can 'enter' the portal on one side and come out on the other.
  
  Portal is area wide, until you reach Grand Master in all spell colours, when it
  becomes mud wide. This was implemented to stop players creating characters that
  were only there so that they could portal to difficult to reach areas.
