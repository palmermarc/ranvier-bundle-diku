  The Ten Commandments:
  1) Kill and decapitate other players, or else:
  2) Other immortals will kill and decapitate you.
  3) Forgiveness may be divine, but vengeance is much more fun.
  4) Don't whine or complain, or someone will kill you.
  5) If someone whines or complains, you should kill them.
  6) If someone DOESN'T whine or complain, kill them anyway.
  7) Might makes right; A corpse will never betray you.
  8) Friends are useful. So is the exp you get for decapitating them.
  9) Rules and alliances are there to be broken; never trust anyone.
  10) Stop reading the stupid rules and let the slaughter commence!
  
  NOTE - These are the 'roleplay' rules, for the PROPER rules of this
  mud (ie the ones you get deleted for breaking) see HELP LAW.
