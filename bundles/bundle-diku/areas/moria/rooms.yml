    You are on a small bewildered path winding its way between the hills in
    lack of better things to do. To the south you have a splendid view over the
    flat, vast, desolate plains. To the north the hills grow steadily darker and
    foreboding. This is the cause of no sunset, it is rather the power of evil
    penetrating these quiet hills. Glancing around you notice only a single bird.

    You are surrounded by dark and sinister hills. Although they seemed fairly
    small from a distance you now get the feeling that they're closing in on you,
    towering over you, overwhelming you ...  The small path seems to have second
    thoughts about these hills because it starts winding unnecessarily, turning
    several times around itself.  To the south the hills have a lighter hue of
    dark. To the north however, the hills have become nightblack holes in the
    distant mountains.

    At this point the path has had enough. With a terrified shudder it cowers
    to the ground, only staying here because you're standing on it. with a slight
    feeling of unease you look around noticing only a few bushes and a large sign
    carved into the mountain.  You feel you can hear the cry of help from a
    thousand silent voices all coming from an even darker hole in the mountain to
    the north marking the entrance to a cave (or a grave :-).

    You are in a large cave. The ceiling is lost somewhere above the reach of
    your light. The floor, however, is highly illuminated, your light flickering
    over several tombstones. Only one is whole, the rest have been shattered by
    some savage blow. The remaining tombstone looks disturbingly new...
    A small breeze of fresh air enters from the south (probably lost too). Take a
    good breath, it may be your last mouthful of air in a long, long time that
    others haven't breathed before you.
    To the north a small tunnel continues into the mountain.
