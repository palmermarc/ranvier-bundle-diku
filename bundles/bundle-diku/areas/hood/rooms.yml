    The walls of the alleyway have been spray-painted over many times
    over the years.  One section of graffiti actually looks legible,
    it says:    This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
                If you are above level 15 please don't expect much fun.
                If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
    Another section of graffiti says "Raff Rules!"
    There is a boulevard to the east and Wall Road East is to the west.
