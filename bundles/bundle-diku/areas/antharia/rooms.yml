  description: >-
    You are standing just south of the grand temple of Anthar.  This seems
    to be the center of life in the city of Antharia -- Antharians are
    passing by here on a regular basis.  Also, you can almost hear the
    humming power radiating from the Gem of Salvation mounted upon the
    Temple.  
        From here you can walk around the temple to the east or west...or
    you can return to the Sea by going south.  There is also a Magical
    sign posted here, put up by the councils of Antharia after the initial
    contact with Anon.

  title: "Entrance Street"
  description: >-
    As you enter from the sea, you suddenly are aware of a type of
    stability and balance that is not typical of being underwater.
    Standing and walking is now almost like being in the open air, thanks
    to the power of the Gem of Salvation.
        Looking ahead you can see the Temple of Anthar just a bit further
    to the north.  The city looks huge from here, even though you know
    that a great portion of the northern section of the city is now in
    ruins, with the waning power of the Gem.  Antharians are walking
    everywhere, a serious people.  They do not seem to be totally
    heartless, just aware of what they have to do to survive.  "Work
    before play" is the motto that Antharians live by.
        Looking directly up..you can see a clear shot right to the
    surface..you're amazed at how easy it is to notice the sun at this
    depth.  More Antharian magic, you think.

    As you get closer to the Temple of Anthar, the power of the gem
    becomes more and more resonate.  The Temple of Anthar is just a bit
    further to the north, and from here you can see the big Gem of
    Salvation mounted on top of it.  The Gem looks, from here, to be a
    huge red stone mounted in a golden tripod.  There is a faint, but
    visible ray of light that emits from the gem, blanketing the city in a
    protective aura.  The sheer power that emits from the gem is awesome
    in iteslf, the wizards of ancient Antharia must have been akin to
    gods.
        The street continues north from here to the Temple, or south back
    to the Sea.

    Every so often you can hear the cry of an infant Antharian coming from
    these houses.  Although they are different from the other races, they
    still have a lot in common with them.  Moreover, the Antharian seem
    content with their lives underwater, showing no signs of resentment
    that their once great empire was completely forgotton on the surface.

        Antharians are very good at making simple houses look like

    The Antharians are very proud of their heritage and grand Antharia is
    a major part of that heritage.  Right now, there is a kind of magic
    wall between this section of the city, and the older ruined section.
    Representatives from the other races and the city of Anon are

    king just prior to the catastrophy that forced Antharia underwater.
    Wanting to be remembered for all time, he had this bridge built in his
    name.  It is a bridge made of the same material as the Temple --
    something that we have no knowledge of today.  However, you can feel
    the material, and it feels smooth and glossy..almost like ivory.  You
    assume that this bridge once spanned a river or something of that
    nature; however, now this bridge spannes a channel filled with the
    same water that you are now breathing.

  description: >-
    As with most bridges built in the past, the bridge rises in the
    center and comes down on both ends.  From here it is a little easier
    to see parts of the city.  Two things stand out more than the rest
    though: the Temple of Anthar to the south, and a larger, more
    spectacular building to the far north.  You assume that this northern
    building is part of the ruins of grand Antharia.
        This bridge is used heavily, as it connects the Temple Circle to
    Center street.

  description: >-
    You are standing here in the exact center of modern Antharia.
    There is a heavy amount of traffic, as people go to and from the
    Temple of Anthar via the bridge, and also this street is a shortcut
    across town.
         Just north of here is a dignified building of Ertuvia the
    Weaponsmith.  Instead of the clanging of metal that is usually
    associated with weaponsmiths, there is only the sound of talking
    coming from the building.
        There is a small street sign here.

    This street seems to split modern Antharia right in the middle,
    making the connection from the eastern part of the city, to the
    western.  Antharians are passing by continually, on their way to see
    Ertuvia or maybe visit the Temple of Anthar.  Walking on Center street
    leaves you know doubt that this is really a bustling city.
       Just north of here is the shop of Heaustf the Armorer.  As with the
    case with Ertuvia, there is no sound of metal upon metal coming from
    the building..just the sound of Antharian voices.

    This road circles around the grand Temple of Anthar.  Just
    standing here, you feel the magnitude of just how much was put into
    its building.  You can only imagine at the amount of labor it took to
    build something of this magnitude.  Now, with the Gem of Salvation
    mounted on the top of the temple, it is even more impressive.  The
    temple seems to be a focus of tremendous power, you fell that if you
    could just get inside, you could aquire some of that power.

    Taking a closer look at the the temple from this angle, you can
    tell that it is made of many different levels.  Seems to be built
    almost as a pyramid:  large at the base, and getting smaller as it
    goes up.  The connections between the levels seems to be implicable,
    almost perfect in its accuracy.  You wonder, did the wizards help in
    this accomplishment, or were the Antharian masons of that time
    incredibly good?  Maybe the secret lies within the temple...

  description: >-
    You are standing at the gate of the zoo of Antharia.  Looking
    through the gate, you get a glimpse of known and unknown animals
    contained therein.  According to the Antharians, the zoo was built
    before the catastophy -- as hard as that might be to believe.  It is
    said that the Council of Clerics at that time insisted that the zoo be
    one of the protected areas.  They wished to preserve the endangered and
    unusual animals that they had aquired through the generations.  Now,
    this is the most extensive and important zoo in the world, as it
    contains animals that is found nowhere else.
        As with many of aspects of the Antharian culture, this zoo is not
    currently opened to non-Antharians.  Hopefully, the other races can
    convince the Antharians to allow other races to explore and
    investigate the zoo.

    society, being the maker of this armor.  His shop does not look like
    an regular armory would -- dirty, smelly, or dark.  Rather, it is
    clean, with Heaustf running the shop like a king running his kingdom.

    that are obviously of Antharian origin.  You wonder what exactly those
