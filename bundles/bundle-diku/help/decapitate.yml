  syntax: DECAP <player>
  
  If you are an avatar or higher, you may decap a mortally wounded player 
  who has your status or higher. By decapping a player you gain one status 
  point, and half of the current exp they have in hand. (ie, if they have 
  1 mil exp you get 500k exp).
  
  A player that is decapped loses all of their exp, 1 immunity, and 1 of each 
  attribute. 
  
  After a player is decapped, their head must be 'cracked' and their brain
  destroyed so they can call their eq.
