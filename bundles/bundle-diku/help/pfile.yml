  A PFILE (player file) is the file where all of your characters data 
  is stored. In some situations you pfile may become SHAGGED and this 
  can cause you to lose stats or equipment, or worse CRASH THE MUD.
  
  If your pfile is SHAGGED (or Buggered, or Bugged, or Corrupted) please 
  do not attempt to log it onto the mud. It may potentially crash the 
  mud, further shagging your pfile, and possibly shagging others.
  
  DO mail the admin at: XXX@xxx.XXX so a Coder can look into 
  the problem. Feel free to log on an alternate character til your
  character is fixed.
