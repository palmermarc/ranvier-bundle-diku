  Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
  it as equipment. HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves. WEAR is for
  armor. WIELD is for weapons.
  
  WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
  inventory.
  
  You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
  match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
  to use it properly.
  
  REMOVE ALL will attempt to remove all items currently equipped.
  
  REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
  inventory.
