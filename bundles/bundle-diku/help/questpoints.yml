  QUEST POINTS are the 'currency' used on the mud to improve equipment.
  To gain QUEST POINTS, you must complete a QUESTCARD. <see help QUESTING>
  Once you have gained QP, you can then use them to improve your EQ in 
  various ways. You can raise the Hitroll, damroll, attributes, add spells, 
  lower ac, reduce weight, and add/remove special flags.
  The syntax for questing different things on EQ follows:
  
  Hit/Damroll: quest <item> hitroll/damroll <number>
  ProtectionAc: quest <item> protection <number>
  AC: quest <item> ac < -number> (make sure this # is negative!)
  Attributes: quest <item> str/int/dex/wis/con <number>
  Extra: quest <item> extra <anti-good/anti-evil/invis/etc..> 
  (You type the same thing to add OR remove. It is a toggle) 
  Hp/Mana/Move: quest <item> hp/mana/move <number>
  Weight: quest <item> weight 
  Min/Max: quest <weapon> min/max <number>
  Spell: quest <item> spell <spellname> (leave <spellname> off to list>
  Power: quest <weapon> power <number>
  Naming Eq: See help FBONUS
