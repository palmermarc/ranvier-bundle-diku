  A REPOP is the timed resetting of mobs and items in an area. Since players
  are always killing the mobs and taking the items for personal use or quest
  cards, the mud must replace them. Each area resets at a set, predetermined
  rate. An area will REPOP/RESET at a much faster rate if all the players
  in that area leave. It will REPOP if players are in the area, but it is 
  MUCH slower. This is why from time to time a player might ask you to leave
  an area for a brief moment so he/she/it can get a quest item.
