  syntax: quest <item> indest
  
  Players who reach status 10 <Adventurer> gain the ability to make their
  eq 'indestructable.'
  
  This ability costs 500qp per item. Items that are made indestructable 
  cannot be broken. The only drawbacks are: you lose the ability to
  sacrifice the eq, and the 'indestructable' powers do not work if the 
  player's status falls below 10.
  
  It is up to you to learn which pieces should be indested.
