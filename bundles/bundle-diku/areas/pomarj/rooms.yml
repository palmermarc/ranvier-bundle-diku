    You are on a mountain path which ascends a steep mountainside.  The trail
    curves around the mountain so that you cannot really see what lies ahead.
    You do sense great evil though coming from the area behind the mountain.

    rise at the end of the peninsula to the north.  To the east you see a stagnant
    swamp, along the shoreline of the Azure sea. Also to the east you spy a cave entrance
