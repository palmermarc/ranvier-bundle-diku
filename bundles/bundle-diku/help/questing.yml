  After you have created a quest card, you must now find the 4 items on
  the card to complete the card. To see the items on your card, type:
  <complete> card
  
  This will list the 4 items. You must now find these items. You may find
  the 'locate' spell helpful: c <locate> <item>
  If you are a vampire, 'scry' will also be helpful.
  
  There are lists of directions to the various areas of the mud (and some
  items) on the VW webpage as well as some of the Clan pages. After you find 
  an item, you must place it on your card by typing: complete card <item>
  
  After you find all four items and place them on your card, you must now 
  find the quest card machine. Directions may be obtained from other players
  or on the directions lists. Once you reach the machine, you need to 
  type: <recharge> <card> <machine>
  
  A token will be generated and you should then eat it to store it in your pfile.
