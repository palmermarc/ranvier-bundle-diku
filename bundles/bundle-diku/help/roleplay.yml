  ROLEPLAY is the act of 'portraying' a 'character' that is not the 
  person's real personality. The 'character' is often one that follows 
  a specific clans stereotypes, and has special individual traits that 
  the person has selected. Serious RP'ers tend to stay 'in character' at 
  all times, while other mudders do not roleplay at all.
  
  On VW, roleplay is not required, but it certainly makes it more fun. 
  We the admin encourage RP. However, most of the players on the mud 
  do not RP. We hope that this will change in the future.
