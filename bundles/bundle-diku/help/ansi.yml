  This will show things in colour. Spells will appear in their appropriate 
  colour, and important messages will be highlighted. Your exp (or opponents
  condition if you're fighting), hp, mana and move are shown in scaled colour.
  Scaled colour is represented as follows:
  
  Cyan : Maximum.
  Yellow : 75% to just below maximum.
  Green : 50% to just below 75%
  Blue : 25% to just below 50%
  Red : Below 25%
  
  Ansi colour can be toggled on and off with the 'ansi' or 'config' commands.
