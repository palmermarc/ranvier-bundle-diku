  BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff. QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as 
  opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids). RECITE recites a magical 
  scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll. 
  ZAP zaps a magical wand at a target. If the target is not specified, and 
  you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target. You must
  HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.
  
  All of these commands use up their objects. Potions and scrolls have a 
  single charge. Wands and staves have multiple charges. When a magical 
  object has no more charges, it will be consumed.
