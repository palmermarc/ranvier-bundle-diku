body: |
  Syntax: Spell: cast voodoo <victim>
  Ability: voodoo <victim> <action>
  
  Voodoo magic allows the caster to do things to another player indirectly.
  First, a body part of the victim is needed. The caster should hold this 
  part and cast the spell on the target (they don't have to be in the same 
  room). This will create the voodoo doll, which the caster the voodoo 
  commands on to interfere with the victim.
  
  There are three voodoo actions. The first, 'Stab', is only of use as a 
  warning to the victim, or to cause annoyance. The second, 'Throw', will 
  hurl the victim from their feet and cause a small amount of damage. The 
  third and final action, 'Burn', will set the victim on fire, as well as 
  destroy the doll itself.
  
  To use a voodoo doll, you must hold it in your left hand.
