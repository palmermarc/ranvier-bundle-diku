  Vampires are the creatures of the night and thus take damage if exposed 
  to daylight. Vampires cannot eat food, or drink any liquids except for 
  blood. If they cannot drink blood for a long duration of time they will 
  start taking damage or maybe even go berserk, so it's a good idea to store 
  some blood in a drinking container. Vampires take half damage from cold, 
  none from gas, and double from fire, although those with the Heat 
  immunity take normal fire damage rather than double. Other abilities:
  
  * Fangs - Gives a free bite attack in combat, and required to 'bite' people.
  * Bite - Transforms target into a vampire, but costs the vampire 1000 exp.
  * Order - As if target lower generation vampire of your clan was charmed.
  * Introduce - Informs everyone in the room of your vampire lineage.
  * Vamptalk - A special vampire channel which distinguishes between clans.
  * Clan channels are also available now. use the first 4 letters of your
  clan+talk .. e.g. nosftalk, gangtalk, malktalk etc...
  * Regenerate - Vampire cannot regenerate naturally; they need to use this.
  * Vclan - Shows information on the other members of a vampires clan.
  * Feed - For feeding other vampires with your blood.
  
  In addition, all vampires get 3 or more disciplines, each of which grant 
  one or more extra powers. For more information type 'help disciplines'.
  The VAMPIRE command toggles on/off whether vampires may bite/feed you.
