  When a player initially logs on to the mud, he or she is a MORTAL. MORTALS 
  are just like you and me, they can die. It takes them a long time to heal.
  They are limited in their abilities. In other words, Mortals are weak.
  
  The main advantage to being a mortal is: Players can't harm you. You will
  not be PKilled. This doesnt mean that you can stay mortal and harass others.
  
  When a mortal feels that he or she is ready for the PK enviroment of the 
  mud, it can train AVATAR. This should only be done after much consideration,
  because it's a rough world and the PK on VW can be extreme and heartless at
  times. If the only reason you are training avatar is to chat, maybe you
  should rethink this, young avatars who chat a lot get killed a lot.
