    Now the Northen Tale begins... Be brave, be careful...
    - Wake, o grey and olden voices,
      send us secret kennings,
      tales of better times
      and the joys of dearer days.
      Come from Endla's waters
      o Vanemuine's daughter.
      You've stroked your silken hair
      at length in that silver mirror.
      Let us take truth's warrant,
      o ancient shadows;
      show the long-departed faces,
      show the coursing of the Kalev's,
      of the hardy men and witches.
      Let us sweep soaringly southward,
      take several steps toward the north,
      to the heather where my seedings
      flower in foreing fields. -

      the wheeling billows
      swing against the stony shore,
      brust in foam against the beach.
      And the waves of our life,
      rolling in the chill of evening
      sway us toward our spelucher,
      beneath a blanket of sod. -

    Tales gathered and written by F.R. Kreutzwald
    - Vanemuine, lend me your lyre.
      A sweet song is stirring my senses
      and I long unfold in song
      the legacy of ancient ages. -
