    The dust-covered hallway has come to an abrupt end at a stony,
    featureless wall.  Here and there are signs of the recent passage
    of others in the dust.

  title: "The Tomb Entrance"
  description: >-
    You are in a small, dark chamber that has stood undisturbed for
    many years.  To the north stands a massive stone tomb, which is
    covered in hieroglyphics and gold-lined carvings that mark it as the
    final resting place of the mighty pharoahs of this land.

  description: >-
    Great golden sarcophogai line the walls of this massive tomb.  It has
    withstood the passage of time intact, untouched by the hands of thieves
    and looters.  The treasures taken by the pharoahs to their graves still
    lie before your feet.

  title: "A Rubble-Strewn Hallway"
  description: >-
    This hallway formerly had a beautiful arch to the ceiling, now
    collapsed under the weight of the slowly settling stones of the
    pyramid.  Now, a massive pile of rubble leads up into a hole high 
    in the northern portion of the hallway.  To the south, through the 
    rubble and fallen stones you see a sandstone crypt.

  title: "A Sandstone Crypt"
  description: >-
    This small crypt is lit by a hole in the wall to the south, through
    which sand pours from the desert outside.  A hot wind blows in from the
    desert, drying your skin instantly.  To the east and north the arched
    hallway continues.

  description: >-
    This hallway has a beautiful arch to it, formed painstakingly and

    covers most of the rest of the pyramid interior is not present here,
    scoured away by the blowing of the desert winds that howl about
    your ears.

  title: "A Golden Crypt"
  description: >-
    You stand inside a small crypt with walls and ceiling made of

    Small rugs and tapestries are scattered about the floor here, and
    they appear to have been used recently.

  title: "A Shining Vault"
  description: >-
    The stones of the pyramid here take on a strange, twinkling quality,
    almost seeming to shine with an internal light.  As you look closer you
    see tiny glass-like glittery particles within the stones, that reflect
    the light from your light source so perfectly that they seem to shine.

  title: "A Massive Sand Dune"
  description: >-
    You stand now on a massive sand dune on the southern side of
    the pyramid.  At the foot of the sand dune to the north you see a
    small hole where the stones of the pyramid have collapsed.  Not
    far to the south is a massive roiling sandstorm; the wind from the
    storm howls and bites at your face even here.

    Somehow you managed to make your way through the howling winds
