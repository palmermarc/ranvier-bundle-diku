    You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of DikuMUD.
    The result of such a foolish act should be punished with death, you know.
    With an acceleration of approximately 9.82 metres per second per second, you
    are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to
    be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.
    You've fallen, and you can't get up!!!

  description: >-
    You are standing in what looks like a bend in the pipe system of the
    sewer. The 'floor' is covered completely by mud! This includes covering
    your legs up to your knees as well. The pipe leads west and south.

  title: "Down the old well"
  description: >-
    You are dangling on the slippery sides of the old well leading down and up.
    The only secure point here is the metal bars that are cemented into the 
    sides, the ones that you cling frantically to so that you don't fall. Who
    knows how deep this well is?

    You stand, swaying out from the ledge, with only a couple of inches of safe,

    south. It seems that the ledge is too narrow to turn on so you'll have to
    continue forward.

    You stand in a rather odd intersection of pipes. The pipes actually don't

    You've just stepped into the most unlucky position in the whole of Merc Mud.

    are now descending the Abyss. What awaits you at the bottom will continue to
    be a mystery. Bye Cruel World.

    You are standing on a ledge that seems quite a lot larger than the rest 
    of the ledges. This one leads to the west and the east, plus it has an exit

    wouldn't be such a good idea. The way south is in utter darkness.
