body: |
  Sometimes while exploring the mud, a player becomes injured. Most times it's 
  minor, a quick heal will fix it, but sometimes it is more serious, and a 
  player will find him/herself without one or more of his/her bodily appendages. 
  When (not if, but when) this happens, don't spam the 'chat' channel w/ requests 
  for a BODYPART. You can often find a bodypart yourself by killing weak mobs 
  with certain weapon types (slice/slash/claw/etc). You can also 'cast locate 
  <bodypart>' and find some parts.
  
  If you're missing an eye - ask once and then put it in your title.. somebody 
  will help you eventually. If you repeatedly ask - you will probally end up 
  much worse.
  
  **You CAN regenerate eyes even if both of yours are poked out if you have one
  in your inventory**
