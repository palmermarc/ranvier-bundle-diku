    variety of foodstuffs found here on the shelves. There are numerous cans of
    tomatoes, peas, corn etc., vines of garlic, a *Huge* array of small spice jars
    along several shelves and a large combo refrigerator/freezer. A big oven and
    stove is lurking in a corner. There is some proof here that Dragon is a less
    than meticulous housekeeper... There are doors to the north and west.

    the eastern one joining the greenhouse to the main building, but it is hard to 
    see out for all the greenery here. There is a set of easy-chairs and a glass
    coffee table. To the south, there is a wide double door out to a sunlit 
    terrace.
