  AVATARS are players on the level of STATUS above Mortal. You start off as a
  Mortal, which means that you can die from being attacked and killed by MOBS.
  When you train up to AVATAR level (this costs 1000 experience points) you can 
  only be killed by being DECAPITATED by someone of the same STATUS as you or 
  lower, and can only be mortally wounded (when you get to -10 hp).
  
  Mortals cannot attack or be attacked by anybody except a MOB, which means that
  they are safe from other players in the game.
  
  One thing to remember is that some players don't like it when other players
  train up to avatar status when they are still weak and pathetic. If you *are*
  still very weak, it is advisable to stay mortal until you can stand up to 
  other avatars. Weak players are liable to be mortally wounded, tied up 
  gagged and blindfolded by other players if they do go up to avatar too soon.
  It is advisable that you gain 2000 hps/mana/move before you train avatar. 
  For refrence: some players have well over 10,000 hps/mana/move with hit/dam 
  of 250/230. They WILL kill you quickly.
  
  You can also chat when you reach avatar status.
