    You have emerged from the dark forest on the plains of the Elven Monarchy
    of Celene, ruled by the good Queen Yolande, under the guidance and
    watchful presence of her God and Mentor, the Elven Immortal Corellon Larethian.
    Tall spires rise in the distance, emerging from the magnificent Elven city of 
    Celene, to which the path you are upon leads.
    There is a small, hand-lettered sign near the path...

    feet long, you estimate, at least twice the length of any you've fought
    before, and to top it off he is a Blackmoor Dragon, who are amongst the most
    powerful of all Wyrmkin. Amazed that the Dragon hasn't reacted to your
    presence yet, you pause and wonder what to to...
