  title: "Mining equipment room"

    This is the storage room for equipment used by the
    Dwarven miners.  It is very small, and you can tell that
    not many miners actually use any equipment.

  title: "Solved the Maze."
  description: >-
    You have solved the maze.  You can tell by the last few moves
    that there is no way that a dumb worker could have figured that
    out.  It seems pretty desolate here.  To the south is a bleak room.
    To the north, you see the maze.  There is a sign above the south exit:
        Those who enter, plan on a timely death.
        Especially if you're loyal to the queen.

    You are at the bottom of the mineshaft.  The air here is very sooty, and
    it is very hard to breath.  The mineshaft leads up and east.
