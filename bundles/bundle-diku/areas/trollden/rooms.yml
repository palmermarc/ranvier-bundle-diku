    This room is filled with bone shards and fragments.  Something (or things)
    very big lives here.  A small plaque is on the wall.

  title: "Troll's Larder"
  description: >-
    This room has blood and grime all over the walls.  You see maggots and other
    insects crawling up them.  The resident is definitely uncivilized.  Half-eaten
    and rotting body parts scatter the floor, each having its own colony of flies,
    worms, and maggots.

    This small cave opens to the north, south, east, and west.  You are
    overcome by the stench and consider turning around.

  title: "The Playpen"
  description: >-
    The walls are covered with blood (and body parts!?!?).  Plastered on the far
    wall you see what looks like a human arm.  A half-eaten body lies here with
    its chest ripped out.  The predator seems disinterested in it.

  title: "Troll's Bedroom"
  description: >-
    Obviously something REALLY big lives here.  The stench is quite unbearable.
    There are piles and piles of rotten and half-eaten body parts of animals,
    orcs, (and humans?) strewn across the floor.  There is a larger, more
    prominent pile of rotten parts over in a corner.  It seems to have been
    flattened by something.
