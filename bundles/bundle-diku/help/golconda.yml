  For most Kindred, to be a vampire is to be eternally Damned. To become 
  vampire means being forever forsaken by God and man. Even those that scorn
  this legend find a personal Hell in their BEAST. The BEAST controls many 
  aspects of a vampire's unlife, including how much damage a vampire takes 
  from the sun.
   Among vampires there is a fabled state of trancendance known as 
  GOLCONDA. A vampire who has attained GOLCONDA is said to have gained a 
  complete mastery over it's BEAST (and an immunity to damage from the sun).
   As the stories go, GOLCONDA is known only to a few among the undead, 
  and these no longer participate in the Jyhad or the society of their kind. 
  They are loners, who live at one with the animals in the wilderness. They 
  are hallowed creatures who no longer have the inborne need to kill.
   If your beast is 0, and you kill, it always goes up, but the more you 
  kill (or do any other beastly thing) the less likely it is to go up. So at 
  50, it's not very likely to raise because you did something beastly. Vampires
  with extremely low or high beasts are extremely rare. (or will be soon)
