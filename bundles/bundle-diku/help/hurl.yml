  Syntax: hurl <name>
  Syntax: hurl <name> <direction>
  
  This ability allows you to hurl the target into walls, through exits, or 
  through doors. Hurling someone through an exit does a little damage. 
  Hurling them into walls does twice as much, and hurling them through 
  doors does three times as much. If you don't specify a direction to hurl 
  the target, it will be random (north, south, east or west). You cannot 
  hurl someone who is already injured.
