  This represents the 'danger' of the player. You only have a status if 
  you are avatar or above. It grants no extra powers, but is a good measure 
  of how deadly that player is in combat. Each time you decapitate an 
  Immortal+ (or an Avatar if you are also an Avatar) your status goes up by 
  one and their status goes down by one (to a minimum of zero). The 
  following shows how many kills (minus deaths) you need for each status:
  
  0 = Avatar
  1 - 4 = Immortal
  5 - 9 = Fighter
  10 - 14 = Adventurer
  15 - 19 = Champion
  20 - 24 = Warrior
  25 + = Hero
