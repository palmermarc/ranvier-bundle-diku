  God Wars was created by Richard Woolcock, aka KaVir.
  Thanks also go to the following people (in order of help given):
  
  ...Zarkas, for teaching me how to mud properly.
  ...Malice, for getting me into the implementor and coder side of things.
  ...ShadoWeaver, for providing me with my first (and free) site.
  ...Rotain, for helping with the code - and the debugging.
  ...Calamar, for adding some nifty code that I still don't understand.
  ...Stephen from ACK mud, for coding advise and suggestions.
  ...Monochrome BBS, for supplying me with a decent free site.
  ...Lucifur, for providing a USA mirror site for the USA players.
  ...Shaddai, for a mirror site, code snippets and bug reports.
  ...Arioch, for comments, suggestions, and help running the mud.
  ...Tepic, for writing the web pages, and helping run the mud.
  ...Pandora, for trying to bring some semblance of order to the mud.
  ...All the players, for finally showing me why God Wars doesn't work.
  
  Note: This mud is based upon a pre-October 1995 version of the code.
