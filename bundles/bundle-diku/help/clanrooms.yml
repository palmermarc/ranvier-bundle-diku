  Clanrooms have changed.
  Gone is the old clan corridor, so don't bother looking there for
  your clan rooms (assuming you are in a clan that is :> ).
  To find your clan rooms, head for the courtyard of Joker's castle,
  and look around the edge of the market place for an archway containing
  the symbol of your clan. When you find it, just say the name of your clan, 
  and you will be taken to your clan rooms. The secret entrance for all clan 
  rooms works the same way, so ask your deity(s) where it is, as most of them 
  will have changed. Non clan members may only enter your clan rooms if 
  invited (ie you send a portal out to them) there is no other way for a non 
  clan member to get in (short of godly intervention), though people in the 
  clan rooms 'can' be summoned out.
  
  If your clan room has not been updated, or you can't find the archway for it
  complain to your clan deities, because they havn't mailed us the info we
  need yet :<
  
  Enjoy.
