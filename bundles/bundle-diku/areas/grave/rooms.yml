  description: >-
    This is the Entrance to the clan room of the Death Clan.
    The Assamite are an odd clan, many kindred are very
    conserned with this clan and its closeness with the dead.
    The Assamites see death not as somthing to be feared
    but as a new begining and the wonders that it brings.

  title: "The Altar."
  description: >-
    This room's aura is strong.
    You see a dark altar before a large religious icon.
    The Assamite crest hangs upon a wall.
    Large stone statues of robed skeletons flank the altar,
    their dread gaze seemingly unending.
    Large benches fill the remainder of the room, their brown wood gleaming.
    Mist arises from incense burners placed about the walls.
    A tall man dressed in robes stands at the altar, meditating.
    He seems to be mumbling something to himself.

  description: >-
    The hallways of the Assamite's clan rooms are as wonderous
    as they are horrific. The walls and pillars adorned with intricate
    carvings of the highest craftsmanship, carvings of death and decay.
    The walls primarily have carvings of dead, decaying corpses, while
    the pillars seem to be constructed of hundreds of polished skulls.

  description: >-
    This room is bare of furniture except for a set of shelves and
    one table upon which lies a single corpse, obviously recently
    dissected for study. Many knives and doctor's tools lie about here.
    This room is full of sights that would horrify anyone but you, a Assamite.  Large jars of blood and body parts are stacked upon a shelf;
    Many corpses lie rotting in a corner. The stench of decay fills the air.

  title: "Dark Study."
  description: >-
    You stand within the private study of the Assamites.
    This is where they keep all their secret books of necromancy.
    The walls are filled with shelves full of texts on the anatomy of animals,
    demons, dragons and even other vampires. Scrolls and parchments are scattered
    about on tables and chairs.
    Scholars and other individuals all come here to study the dark arts.
    Every Assamite understands his or her immortality and learns to harness
    its power for his or her own purposes.
    A sense of darkness comes from the south, and you feel a cool draft from
    the north.

    Off to the far wall you notice an odd picture dipicting Joker in his youth.

    This room has only a large pool within it filled with blood.
    The blood is said to heal a vampire, restore their vigore and
    enrich their mind. The blood is also said to have some of Joker's
    blood mixed within, this is belived to be a large source of the
    Assamite's abilty to animate corpese and manipulate the dead.
    Many hold this as sacred ground.

  description: >-
    You feel the room's icy touch; a cold breeze claws at your face and bare skin.
    The light from this room is dim and seems to darken as you move on.
    Large slabs of stone are lined up like tables within the room.
    The slabs contain the corpses of the varius monsters and specimens
    that have fallen to your clan. Though you are not warriors, your skill
    at magic has surpassed even that of the great Tremere.
    Even you are amazed at how fast you have learned your magic
    and gained a true understanding of the Dead.
    The smell of rotting flesh fills your nostrils and gives your undead
    nature a certain sense of joy.  How sadistic you must be to enjoy this.
    Yes, this is a trait of your clan.  Death.  Decay.  You understand them
    better than any.  And only you, a true Assamite, can look upon a 
    corpse and see beauty.

    to dispose of the specimens collected by the clan after their study.
    Many dismembered corpes lie about the room.
    Nearing the exit of this room you can see the dim light of the outside world,
    the world above awaits you yet again.

    This plain room is littered with what most would call a treasury but the 
    Assamites have little use for such trinkets and so the modest wealth
    within this room comes from the corpses of their studies.
    Resting here until a member of the clan requiers it for use in a spell
