    This is one shop that seems to be ahead of its time.
    But who doesn't like scuba diving. If you don't already have
    a diving license you can buy one. Lexie can also train you too. Not  in
    scuba though. Something about a revoked teaching credential due to too
    many students dying or something. This does seem to be an odd place to have
    a scuba shop considering the sea is miles away. But I guess you could
    always go diving in the lake. But why?....

    This is the Marketplace of Solace. Where the farmers come to sell their

  description: >-
    This is where Jhen the farmer comes to sell his crops. His wooden vegtable
    cart stands here filled with all sorts of vegetables. All his vegtables are 
    unusually large. What kind of plant food does he use anyway...?
    There is a small sign nailed to the cart.

  title: "Krista's Fruit Stand."
  description: >-
    This is where Krista peddles her fruits. Every year she travels from her
    orchards in the mountains to Solace to sell her fruit. Everything seems
    to have an unusually small size. I wonder if she shrinks heads too...
    There is a small sign hanging above the fruit stand.

    This is Janni's Souvenir shop. He makes trinkets year round that he peddles

  title: "Nisi's Frozen Food"
  description: >-
    This is one of the oddest venders in the marketplace. Nisi claims to have
    various fresh frozen types of vegetables. They are frozen all right. In 
    fact they are hard enough to stop an axe swing...go figure..
    And just how does she keep them from melting... 
    There is a small sign on the wall in the back of the shop.

    This is the shop of the famous mulburry extract. Known throughout the
    valley to quech the thirst of even the thirstiest traveller. What else it does
    is just rumor. That person recovered in a month anyway...
    There is a small sign on the wall.

  description: >-
    This is one shop to stay away from. Rashan's rutabagas have been know
    to do strange things to people. And true to its reputation the shop is
    very very empty. I'm sure Rashan would be more than willing to sell
    you one. Business obviously has been very slow....
    There is a small sign hanging next to you.
