    Wow!  Although this hallway is quite filthy and dusty, it is noticeably
    different than the rest of the catacombs ... but you don't feel safe yet.
    The walls faintly show ancient detailed etchings in gold and silver of
    ancient rituals ... not all of which seem pleasant.  The hallway continues
    north into the catacombs and further south as long as you can see.
