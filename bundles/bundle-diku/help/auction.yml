  These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.
  
  SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world. To curb excessive
  shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.
  
  AUCTION/BID, CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all
  interested players. '.' is a synonym for CHAT. The QUESTION and ANSWER
  commands both use the same 'question' channel
  
  YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.
  
  You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.
