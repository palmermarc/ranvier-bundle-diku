  This mud is PK mud. PK stands for Player Killing, and that is the main 
  activity intended for players to participate in. Sure, killing huge 
  monsters is fun, but they typically cannot think, so they offer little 
  challenge. If you do not like PK, maybe this isnt the mud for you, because 
  if you AVATAR here, you WILL be killed sooner or later; if no reason other 
  than the fact that you are an avatar.
  
  However, if you feel you are ready for KILLING, there are a few things you 
  should take into consideration. When you first log on, you won't be able 
  to compete with most people who have only played a few hours more than you. 
  Don't despair, with a few hours of work, you will be able to compete. Don't 
  let initial drubbings by HUGE players who are typically 5 to 10 times your 
  size or age discourage you. Of course they can destroy you, they're big, 
  old Vampires.
  
  You should spend your time hunting and killing people who are within your
  age bracket (give or take 25-50 years). A few thousand hps, hitroll/damroll
  of at least 50/50, and ac of -250 will put you on par with most advanced 
  newbies, and on a road to fun. Remember: Vampires are hard to kill.
