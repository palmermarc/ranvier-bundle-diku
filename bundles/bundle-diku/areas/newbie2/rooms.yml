    Welcome weary traveller.  
    To help you on your adventure here, you find yourself in 
    the newbie-zone. If you are totally new to mudding, please
    go west. If you know about muds and just want the quick tour
    of Vampire Wars specific features, go east now.

    This is a different version of the tour, it only highlights 
    things which are specific to this mud.
    For the first step, head north.

  description: >-
    As a new player to muds, this section of hallway leading 
    north should equip you with the basic knowlege you need to 
    begin here.  
    Please type north to move on to the first step.

  title: "Movement."
  description: >-
    To move about on muds, as you have just done, you use the
    commands, north, east, south, west, up and down.  You can
    also use shortcuts of n, e, s , w , u and d to save time.
    Please move north to continue.

  title: "Navigating"
  description: >-
    If you type 'autoexit on' now, the mud will automatically
    list what exits are around you.  This makes moving around 
    much easier.  To help you find what players and mobs are 
    near you, you can use the 'scan' command which shows things
    immedietly around you one location in each direction.
    Please move north to continue your discovery.

  title: "Equipment."
  description: >-
    You can pick up and wear equipment (eq) here.  You may find 
    things lying on the ground, and to get them, simply type 'get
    whatever'. Sometimes mobs or players you kill will have eq
    in them.  In order to see what is inside of a corpse, you 
    must type 'examine corpse'.  This will show you a list of 
    all articles contained within.  To get these items, type 
    'get whatever corpse'.  To drop an item from your inventory,
    type 'drop whatever'.  To wear eq you have picked up, type
    'wear whatever'.  You may also use 'get all', 'drop all' and
    'wear all' if it makes it easier for you.
    Northward continues the tour.

  title: "Killing."
  description: >-
    Killing is very brutal and barbaric, but if you didn't 
    like it, you wouldn't be here.  Killing is very easy.  Just 
    type 'kill whatever', or you can type 'k' as a shortcut for kill. 
    Almost all commands have a shortcut, try a few out.
    TIP : sacrafice corpses for a gold coin (very usefull) 'sac corpse'.

  title: "Score."
  description: >-
    Score command tells you all you ever needed to know about yourself 
    but were afraid to ask. It has all your vital stats listed there.  
    For information on each one, continue through this area until you 
    meet the Guardian and simply ask him for help on each one by saying 
    the word.  For example, 'say hp' for information on what hp (hit 
    points) are, and he will help you out.

  title: "BACKUP."
  description: >-
    This command is very basic and easy to understand. It has a room
    of its own because it is often forgotten about, and players go 
    on for weeks or months having never used the command and not
    worrying ... until something goes wrong!  Backup copies your
    player-file (your character) to a backup directory, so that if 
    anything happens to you which shouldn't, like a bug, or your file
    gets destroyed in a crash (it can happen) then we have a copy 
    of you nice and safe to quickly and easily back-you-up.  If, 
    however, you didn't use the command, you are stuffed! theres 
    literally nothing we can do for you.
    USE IT REGULARLY, or you WILL regret it.
    We advise you to use it at least once each time you mud. The best
    habit is to save and backup before you leave each time you play.
    It is also advisable to save and backup after you achieve something
    important, ie. mastery of a new stance or spell, etc.
    (You cannot use it yet, as you are not yet saved.  You can only save
    after you make five mob kills.)

    That wasn't so bad was it, eh?
    That's your basics over with.  East of here is the Guardian who can
    answer many of your questions.  When you are in the room with him, 
    type 'say hints' and he will tell you a list of hints he has for you 
    to choose from.
    If you still have problems, try looking at the help files and type
    'help whatever'.  If you're still in doubt after that, then ask a
    player or deity - they will help you along.

  title: "Stances."
  description: >-
    Vampire Wars has 10 stances, 4 basic and 6 advanced.  Stances are purely for combat,
    they are a tactical and strategic feature which make fighting a whole lot more fun.
    Each one has its advantages and bonuses, and its weaknesses.  See if you can work 
    out the best combination for fighting in, against each of the stances.
    See help stances for more info.

    This is the gateway from the safety of the newbie instruction area out in 
    to the cold harsh world, well actaully in to the newbie zone where you can 
    hunt and kill to gain those important 5 mob kills and get some experience. 
    Go North and Down to the temple square where you can be transported into 
    the prehistoric newbie area where you can start your journey in safety. 
    (For a short period of time)
    Good luck brave adventurer!
