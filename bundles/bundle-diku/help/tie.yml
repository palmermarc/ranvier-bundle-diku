  TIE allows you yo tie up another player, who must be stunned, 
  incapitated, or mortally wounded. While tied up, a players actions are 
  limited - they cannot move, quit, or do many other commands.
  
  UNTIE will untie a player who is currently tied up. A player cannot 
  untie themself.
  
  GAG places a gag over the mouth of the target player, who must first be 
  tied up. This command will also remove a gag. A player can only remove 
  a gag from themself if they are no longer tied up. It is not possible 
  to talk or use any of the channels while gagged.
  
  BLINDFOLD places a blindfold over the eyes of the target player, who must 
  first be tied up. The blindfold can also be removed with this command. 
  A player can only remove a blindfold from themself if they are no longer 
  tied up. Unsurprisingly, blindfolded players cannot see.
