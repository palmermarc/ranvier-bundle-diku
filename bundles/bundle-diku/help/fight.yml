  Syntax: fightstyle <number> <style>
  
  This is used for unarmed combat, and it allows the fighter to decide on 
  their style of unarmed attack. Many different types of attack are 
  possible, each with different advantages and disadvantages. Your first 
  attack in combat always uses the first number slot. If you have a second 
  attack, this will draw a fighting technique from slots 1 to 4. If you 
  have a third attack, it will draw a fighting technique from slots 5 to 
  8. Any other attacks are randomly drawn from any of slots 1 to 8. If 
  the slot is blank (0) then the attack is a standard unarmed attack.
