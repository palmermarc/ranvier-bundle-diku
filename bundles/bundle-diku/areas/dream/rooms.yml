    You are following a road at the top of a mountain ridge with sky all around
    you.  Distant valleys are spread out below you on both sides.  There are
    many horsemen and horsewomen on this road, riding hell-for-leather out of
    sheer exhilaration.  You wish you had a horse!
    You may recall now if you like.

    This is the Yule Tree Farm at the top of Mountain Road.  All around you,
    young Yule Trees saturate your senses with dark green needles and pine
    essence.

  title: "The Void"
  description: >-
    You are suspended in cool electric space above a translucent plain.  You feel
    synesthesia invading your nerves and reshuffling your senses.  The sky is the
    same obsidian color as the ground and you can't find a horizon.
