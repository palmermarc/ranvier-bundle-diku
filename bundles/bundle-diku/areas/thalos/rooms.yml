    This cramped dwelling could not have housed more than one person. Now
    with the back wall missing, it could hold many more. Looking around you
    find broken shelves and workbenches with various vials and pouches spilling
    contents all across the floor. This was possibly the magic shop of the
    city. The doorway to the east is blocked, making the only exit back west.

    a city here seem much more reasonable). Closer inspection of the water
    yields a dead body floating around in it, skin melted away from months
    of floating in there. The west wall has collapsed revealing another

    have fallen from the walls and roof, sending sunlight streaming in on
    you. A few books lie about, conveying to you a holy message in a
