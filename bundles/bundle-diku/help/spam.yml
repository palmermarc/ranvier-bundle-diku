  SPAM is any repeated command, usually one of the communication commands
  (tells, chats), but not limited to just chats/tells. It is possible to
  spam any channel, spam with emotes or socials, and spam with some other
  commands such as 'consider.' 
  
  SPAM is a bad thing, and spamming of public channels is illegal.
  
  It's also illegal for mortals to spam avatars.
  
  If you spam, don't whine when you get punished or killed.
