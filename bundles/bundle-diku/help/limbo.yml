  LIMBO is a special room for players who do not input any commands 
  after a certain amount of time. This is a built in safety feature 
  for those players who are afk for long periods of time. Players 
  who are in LIMBO cannot be reached by other players, and if they 
  do not input any commands after a few minutes in LIMBO, they are 
  automatically logged off the mud.
