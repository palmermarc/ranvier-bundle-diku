    You are standing on the plains. This is a vast desolate place where the
    wind can howl undisturbed since nothing but you bars its way. However you
    are not the first to wander here. Before you somebody has left a small path.
    The path looks rather bewildered and is not the kind of path to lead to
    anywhere significant or important but it seems to have made up its mind to
    enter the hills far away north.

    The trail of the horsemen continues east and north along this path through

    The path comes to an abrupt end here, as the trees close around you and
    make any further exploration impossible.  Fresh tracks cover the ground, and
