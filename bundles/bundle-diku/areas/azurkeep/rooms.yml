  description: >-
    The forest path leads to a monolith gate
    standing over 100 fathoms tall. The latch
    appears to be rusted and a clear path lies
    beyond. In the distance you see dark skys 
    over what appears to be some sort of building.

    The Gate to the south appears to be shut as if never
    touched. There are several bushes trimmed into peculiar figures.
    The sky clearly shines overhead and darkens over what you make
    out as an enormous temple to the north. A strange glow beckons
    you from there.
