  Syntax: wimpy
  Syntax: wimpy <number>
  
  WIMPY sets your wimpy value. When your character takes damage that reduces
  your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
  
  WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.
  
  Some monsters are wimpy.
  
  NOTE - Higher status people do not have the same luxuries as low status
  people. After all, you should not be Fighter and above if you are
  a coward. Because of this, if you are fighter or above, you will
  not earn as much experience if you have a wimpy value set, and
  once you reach Adventurer status, you may not have a wimpy value
  set at all (for those of you that are Adventurer or above allready
  and have a wimpy set, it will no longer make you flee in combat ;p ).
