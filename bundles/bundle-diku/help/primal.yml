  Primal energy is the ultimate form of energy in the multiverse, the one 
  from which all other energies are derived. Unfortunately, unlike mana, 
  primal energy is only one-use, and is generally used for very powerful 
  spells, such as 'voodoo' (which uses 5 points) and 'quest' (which uses 1 
  to 100 points - see HELP QUEST).
