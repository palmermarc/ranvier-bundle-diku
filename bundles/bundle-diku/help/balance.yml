  'Balance is the true path of the warrior'
  
  This said, special code is put into place that affects the 'balance' of
  a player's hps/mana/move. The more balanced your stats are, the harder
  your hits hit.
  
  This code starts to affect your player when you reach 3000 in any stat.
  (hps/mana/move)
