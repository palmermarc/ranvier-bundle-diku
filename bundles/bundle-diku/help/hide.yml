  Syntax: HIDE
  Syntax: SNEAK
  Syntax: VISIBLE
  
  If you successfully HIDE, then other characters can't see you. If you 
  attack while hidden, the surprise attack will inflict one and a half 
  times your normal damage (assuming your opponent cannot see you).
  
  If you successfully SNEAK, then you can move in and out of rooms without
  being noticed.
  
  In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
  skill.
  
  VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
  making you visible again.
