  To set your recall point, enter the desired room and type 'home here'. 
  From that point on you will recall to that point rather than the Temple 
  of Midgaard (although you still go to the Templar Altar if you die).
  
  Your 'home' will be reset to the temple if you are staked.
  
  A home cannot be a safe room. (Or other "special" rooms that we choose)
