  description: >-
    This section of the path is slowly being drowned by the nearby swamp to the
    south, which is creeping slowly inland.  Several caved-in buildings sprawl
    here, torn apart both by battle and the elements.

  description: >-
    Briars and marsh plants stick to your boots and clothes, and clouds cover the
    skies above the murky marsh, leaving the path before you dark and sinister.
    You see some disturbances in the marsh, but after a few strangled screams,
    the sounds stop.

  description: >-
    This area is by no means a forest, but for those who dwell in these sparse
    trees it is one.  Occasionally you see a whole humanoid form floating face down
    in the water, but mostly you only find pieces.  You hear a loud bellow in the
    distance.  And feel fear creep into your heart.

    You stand in an oozing quagmire.  A creaking beat fills the air,

    of place, and feel that the occupants of this realm will soon
