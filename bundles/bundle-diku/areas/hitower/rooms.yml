    You are in a small clearing in the shadow grove. There is charred grass
    underfoot, and the signs of fire here and there. It is almost as if the
    plant life shuns this spot. The shadowy mist hovers all around, obscuring
    your view into the grove.
      A small path leads north to some shadowy structure. All other exits are
    shrouded in shadowy mist.

    You are in a large hallway, wide enough to accommodate several people
    standing abreast. The floor here is a swirl of multicolored patterns, in

  title: "The entranceway"
  description: >-
    You are at the entrance to the audience chamber of the grand master of
    magic. Beautiful tapestries displaying the ancient masters of lore are on
    the walls, and the floor is covered with a plush multicolored carpet, which
    seems to rustle and move at the touch of your boots.

  title: "The audience chamber"
  description: >-
    You are in a large chamber. Small bolts of energy leap from wall to wall,
    crackling with power. The floor is a swirl of indeterminable colors and
    patterns ever changing. Bright bursts of color seem to explode into the air
    and fade again at random times. All this splendor plays about and draws
    attention to a large throne in the center of the room, it seems to be cut
    from a single enormous emerald.

  title: "A dressing room"
  description: >-
    You are in a plush dressing room. Fine garments of many styles and some
    outlandish colors hang from a rack suspended in mid air at eye level. The
    only other interesting feature in the room is a large silver mirror on a
    finely crafted gold stand.

  title: "The library"
  description: >-
    You are in a small cozy looking library. A few well made books sit atop
    shelves which span every wall. A large oaken writing table is in the center
    of the room with odd papers and parchments on it. The illumination here,
    to your surprise is a quite un-magical oil lamp.

  title: "The altar"
  description: >-
    You are in a small chapel designed around a beautifully crafted golden
    altar. Many icons to lesser deities line the room, but it is obvious by one
    glance at the symbols on the altar, that this room was designed for the
    worship of Mystra, the goddess of magic.

  title: "A passage"
  description: >-
    You are in a small dark passage, which would be unremarkable if not for
    the fact that it ends in a blinding blue light to the west. On hooks set
    into the wall here there hang several travel worthy cloaks, and a small
    leather backpack.  It looks as if someone has prepared this room to be used
    in the event speedy of a evacuation.

  title: "In the light"
  description: >-
    You seem to be floating in a magical energy field, though you cannot see
    the source of the energy, you can feel its power pushing at you from all
    sides, completely negating the effects of gravity.
      An imperfection in the uniform blue can be seen overhead, it might be an
    exit.

  description: >-
    You are in a small, very messy room. An unmade bed is against one wall, and
    books and papers cover every available flat surface. Empty beer cans lie here
    and there, discarded with total abandon. A few over full ashtrays can be seen
    on a desk.
