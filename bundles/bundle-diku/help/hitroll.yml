  A player's HITROLL is the number that the mud uses to determine how likely 
  it is that a player will hit a target. The higher the HITROLL, the more 
  likely a player is to hit a target.
  
  A player's DAMROLL is the number the mud uses to determine how much damage 
  a player will do when he hits a target.
  
  There are other factors involved, but a player's HITROLL and DAMROLL give a 
  good indication of their relative power.
  
  The maximum HITROLL/DAMROLL on the mud is 250/230 (unspelled).
