  COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory. If both objects are weapons,
  it will report the one with the better average damage. If both objects are
  armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.
  
  COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
  you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.
  
  COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
