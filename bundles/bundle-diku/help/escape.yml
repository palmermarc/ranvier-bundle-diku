  This command allows you to transport to the Temple of Midgaard when 
  mortally wounded. This comes in handy when you are morted by an agressive 
  mob (or player). Unfortunately, it also reduces both your mana and move to 
  0, and informs everyone else on the mud that you are lying defenseless at 
  recall...so be careful how you use it.
