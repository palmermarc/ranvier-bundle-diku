  title: "The Clearing"
  description: >-
    You are standing in a large clearing.  In the side of a grassy bank,
    entwined with the roots of an old tree, stands a massive door of stone. 
    Tall letters are carved across the face of it.  You pick moss from them with
    a knife, revealing the words, "Here lies Vallandar, who was and will again
    be King."

  title: "Entrance corridor"
  description: >-
    You find yourself at the eastern end of a long gothic-arched corridor
    about 12 feet wide.  A faded tapestry hangs along the wall to your south. 
    It depicts a host of warriors locked in gory battle.

  title: "The map room"
  description: >-
    You enter an octagonal room about 15 feet across.  The floor is
    extraordinary - it seems to be made of smooth polished quartz, and below it
    you can see a curious design of greens and blues overlaid with a scattering
    of glowing red symbols.

  description: >-
    You are approaching the end of the corridor.  Double doors lie ahead - of
    black wood bound with verdigris-stained copper.  There is a smaller door in
    the north wall, and a passage leading off to the south.  The tapestry
    flutters, though there is no breeze.  Even as you watch, three of the
    warriors become solid and step into the corridor behind you.  They wear
    strange sculpted armour, still in the faded hue of the tapestry, and their
    faces are the colour of old cloth.  But their wide-bladed short- swords
    appear all too real...

  title: "A hovering wand"
  description: >-
    The passage brings you to a small circular chamber with no other exits. 
    The wall is covered with markings that follow some unfathomable geometric
    principle.  A wand hangs in the air in the middle of the chamber.  It is
    rotating about its centre, at a rate of roughly one revolution a second. 
    One end of the wand glows a dull red, the other sparkles with blue-white
    light.  The central section is black and unreflective.

  description: >-
    At last you reach the top and haul yourself up into a vast cavern. 
    Stalactites sparkle in light which seems to come from all around.  Your
    heart skips a beat as you behold, curled atop an enormous mound of treasure,
    the long sinuous form of a huge red Dragon!  Luckily for you, it is
    sleeping; wisps of blue smoke curl gently up from its black nostrils.  Near
    it, contained within a red pentacle inscribed on the cavern floor, is a
    stout old oak whose branches reach up to the shadows beyond the magic light.

  description: >-
    You swing back the heavy door of a long hall.  At the north end, Your
    lantern-light falls upon a podium of grey marble carved to resemble a
    bulbous-cheeked face blowing at you.  A silver goblet rests on the podium. 
    Beyond, another door leads deeper into the underworld.

  title: "Barrier of light"
  description: >-
    The way on is blocked by a flickering barrier of violet light that
    shimmers in the air between two baroquely carved pillars on either side of
    the passage.  Through the shimmering, you can just barely discern the
    outlines of the corridor as it continues north.  
    Just in front of this barrier, set back in alcoves to your left and right,
    are two fountains.  In the western alcove, a chalky grey liquid issues
    from a snarling stone face and runs down into the fountain beneath.  The
    eastern fountain is filled by a purple liquid that bubbles from a face
    sculpted in an expression of fear.

  title: "Underground river"
  description: >-
    Passing through the barrier of light, you continue north along the
    corridor.  The sound of a surging underground river echoes from the darkness
    ahead.  
    Before long you come to a short flight of steps.  At the bottom you see a
    stone quay beside the rushing black waters.  A rickety plank bridge leads
    across to another quay on the far side.
    A figure of rose-coloured rock stands between the steps and the bridge.  It
    looks like an uncompleted statue - the upper torso, arms and head are
    perfectly sculpted, but the lower body is a single lump of unworked stone.
    With a harsh grating noise it slowly flexes its massive sinews.  Its long
    talons are knives of flint.

  description: >-
    You enter a low-ceilinged chamber hung with sombre drapes.  A flickering
    sanctuary lamp burns on an altar stone in an alcove in the east wall.  A
    large crucifix hangs above this.  There are double doors in the west wall
    and another small door, like the one you have entered by, directly opposite
    you, too the north.

    A narrow passage leads north for a short distance and then turns to the

    ceiling.  The passage extends as far east as you can see.

    Beyond the double doors lies a 9 foot wide corridor which leads west.  A
    little over 25 feet away from where you are standing, it is joined by
    another corridor leading north.  The east-west corridor is gloomy,
    illuminated only by the murky light of your lanterns.  But you can see
    bright light flooding from the northern branch.

    You walk towards the T-junction.  In the bright bar of light thrown

    shadow.  Someone is waiting just around the next corner.  You pause and hold
    your breath as you study the outline of the shadow.  Could it be a robed
    woman with an elaborate coiffure?  A soft, evil hissing reaches your ears...

    The northern branch of the corridor, where the Gorgon was lying in wait,

    Shining your lantern west, you discover that the transverse corridor also
    ends in double doors after another 20 or 30 feet.

    This narrow passage goes north a short distance and ends in a pit.

    the foot of the steps, your lantern picks out the shining surface of
    a massive gold casket.

  description: >-
    Tatters of deepest shadow flit from the furthest recesses of the hall,
    clustering and coalescing on the steps in front of you.  Two darkly
    glittering eyes fix upon you as a manlike form takes shape.  The sense of
    abiding malevolence descends like a pall.  The figure drifts up towards you.
    Its body and fluttering robes are murky and indistinct, but you see its
    white hands and hate-filled visage with a terrible clarity.  It reaches back
    and seems to draw a spectral sword from the empty air.

    Around Vallandar, twelve mighty swords stand balanced upon their points
    in a perfect circle.
