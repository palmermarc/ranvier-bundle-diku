  description: >-
    Before you, the grove of shadows lies. Giant grey trees are all that
    can be seen through the thick shadows. A great sense of both power and
    menace permeates the surrounding area. You have a strange urge to turn
    back and go back the way you've come.
      A small path leads north into the shadows and back south to the road.
