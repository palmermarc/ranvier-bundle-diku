    There is a noticable crater here from when you fell in. Ice is visible 
    all around and a magnificant view. The area is extremely chilly and 
    it looks like you just can't jump or fly back up to the miniscule hole 
    in the far reaches of the ceiling. Many tunnels appear to branch off and 
    yield confusing twists and turns. You almost trip over a small plaque
