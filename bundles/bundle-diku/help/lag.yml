  Lag sucks big time. It's where the network gets mucked up and everything starts
  going really s l o w l y. There is also a social called LAG which displays to
  other players <player> starts complaining about the terrible lag. If you ever
  find a cure to lag, you'll be rich. But then we all know you won't. Lag is the
  equivalent of a day when you come back from a hard day at work and find that your
  fridge has broken down and all the beer has gone warm and flat.
  
  Complaining about lag doesn't help, so don't bother - you're probaly not the
  only person lagging. And besides, who wants to wait several minutes to see
  somebody complaining? Lag is caused by several different things, most commonly
  a downed router on the net. Although it can be caused by the server VW is on,
  this isn't common.
