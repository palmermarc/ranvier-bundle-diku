  Syntax: group <character>
  
  FOLLOW starts you following another character. To stop following anyone else,
  just FOLLOW <yourself>.
  
  GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
  Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
  SPLIT commands. If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
  join the fight.
  
  If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
  kick out the <character> from your group. Characters can also leave your
  group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.
  
  GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
