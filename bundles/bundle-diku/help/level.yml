  Levels are used in many MUDs, but not in Vampire Wars. Normally they dictate
  various things, such as what areas you can get into and other stuff, but in
  Vampire Wars, you don't have to worry about levelling.
  
  One other thing is that you don't have to train at a secific place, such as 
  an acolyte or guild master. You can train any place that you like, provided 
  you have enough experience points. For more information type: help train
  or : help experience
