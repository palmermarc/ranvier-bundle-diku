    No souls have ever lived in this place.  The wails of slaves
    and the howls of wolves are the only way you can describe the sounds
    you hear.  The walls are thin and wispy.  The only light you receive
    is the shimmering from the strand of the ethereal web you used to get
    here.

    A single spider line supports you once more.  As you look

    the window.  You sense a great evil coming from the east and feel
    inclined to go back on the ethereal web and take your chances there.

    Here you see evidence of a vagrant's abode.  The shack is to the

    You can still bail out since your knees are shaking from the
    anticipation (or is it fear?).  The sky is clear on this strand of
    web, surprisingly unsticky.  The strand does not vibrate like the
    others.  A few ballooning spiders pass by, cackling "You're gonna
    die, you're gonna fry.  Good bye!"

    This is the lair of the Empress Spider, Arachnos.  A lavishly
    adorned rainbow web, her lair allows her to move to any universe
    she wishes by using her magical strands to the Prime Material Plane.
    Coffers upon coffers of gold, magical jewels and gems await.  Unfor-
    tunately Arachnos is a baggy spider too, and webs all her treasures
    to her beautiful silken body.
