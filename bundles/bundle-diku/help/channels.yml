  With no options, CHANNELS shows you your current channels. With a plus or
  minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.
  
  You must be an avatar to use channels.
  
  Several players have mentioned a roleplay channel, and I think that 
  vamptalk works well as a roleplay channel <unless you get staked>.
  It is best to consider all public channels as potential roleplay
  venues, including 'say.' However, it is safe to say that not all 'tells'
  are 'in character.' Tells between Players and Admin should always be 
  considered 'out of character.'
