  Players can now create their own 'created' eq without the aid of an Admin. 
  To see which items you may create, type: QLIST. To purchase the item, 
  type: QBUY <ITEM>. The QP price for each item will be automatically removed 
  from your pfile. You will be given a created item with a generic name. If 
  you would like to change the name of this eq, please feel free to go fighter, 
  and then you can rename it yourself.
  
  see also: CLAIM, SPELLPROOF, FBONUS, INDEST, QUEST, and QP.
