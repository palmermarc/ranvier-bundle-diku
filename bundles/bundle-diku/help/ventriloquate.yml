  Syntax: cast ventriloquate <speaker> <message>
  
  This spell throws your voice, making it appear that some other object or
  character in the room is saying your message. Victims who make their saving
  throw will know that someone is using ventriloquism, but not who. Victims who
  fail their saving throw will think that the object or character really did say
  your message.
