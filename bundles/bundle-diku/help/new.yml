  TO ALL NEWBIES (mortals and such)
  Suggestion 1: Shaddup - talking / chatting will get you killed
  Suggestion 2: ask once - do not pester people
  Suggestion 3: there will always be ways to kill newbies -
  don't bug ppl and you won't be a statistic
  
  A NEWBIE should recall to 'The Temple of Midgaard' and say 'take me home' 
  to enter the newbie zone. You will find easy to kill mobs and a set of
  newbie eq here.

  BASICS, BODYPARTS and **ESCAPE**.
