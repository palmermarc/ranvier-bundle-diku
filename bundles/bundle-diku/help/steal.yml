  Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
  Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>
  
  STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character. If you fail
  against a mob, it will typically attack you. There are *NO* penalties for 
  using STEAL on other players, except that it announces to the mud when you 
  fail, so if you spam steal and fail everytime - you spam the mud and that
  will get you in big trouble.
  
  In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
  
  *NOTE* - Currently, steal is a useless skill, you will be able to steal
  NOTHING of value from a a mob you cannot kill and if by some chance
  you do manage to steal something from a player, it'll probaly be
  claimed and they'll just type: call all and get it back.
