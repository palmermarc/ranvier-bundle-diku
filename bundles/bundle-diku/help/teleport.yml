  Syntax: cast <teleport>
  Syntax: cast <teleport> local
  
  This spell takes you from your current location to a random location somewhere
  in the world, although it is only area wide, until you reach Grand Master in all
  spell colours, when it becomes mud-wide. When you become GS all, you must 
  type: cast <teleport> local to teleport within an area.
