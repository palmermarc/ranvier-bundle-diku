  Syntax: cast quest
  
  This spell creates a quest card. The quest-point value of the card is 
  the same as the amount of primal the caster has at the time of casting 
  (and this primal is used up during the casting of the spell). No more 
  than 100 primal will be used on any one casting of this spell. The 
  difficulty of a quest card is totally random. A one point card could
  potentially be harder than a 100 point card.
  
  Quest Cards are automatically claimed by the maker, and cannot be gifted.
