    You are at a crossroads to the wilderness areas east and north of here,
    and the more civilized areas to the west. The main road is west, an
    older road continues east, and a simple trail heads north.  To the south,
    an old ram-shackle building is being used as a trading post for the
    surrounding wilderness.
