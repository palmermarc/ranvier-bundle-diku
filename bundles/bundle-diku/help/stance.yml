  Syntax: stance <style>
  
  In combat, the stance of the fighter plays a very important role; you 
  can't just stand there and exchange blow for blow unless you are very 
  confident of your ability. Each fighting stance has advantages and 
  disadvantages, the basic outline of which follows:
  CRANE : A solid stance, letting you hold your ground, while providing
  good defensive moves.
  MONGOOSE: A light-footed stance, which relies on leaps and acrobatics
  to keep you out of harms way.
  VIPER : A fast, striking stance, which sacrifices defence for speed
  and accuracy.
  BULL : A low stance designed for very powerful and aggressive attacks.
