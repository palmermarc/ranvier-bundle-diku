  description: >-
    You are in a vast hall, filled with the commanders of the Golden Citadel.
    Golden tiles etched with platinum cover the floors, and weapons of all types
    are mounted on the walls of this meeting hall.  Surrounding a solid gold table
    are four sons of the Keeper of the Golden Citadel.  They smile at you and ask 
    you to join them in lunch.  Exits lead to the cardinal directions.

  title: "An Upper Chamber of the Golden Citadel"
  description: >-
    You are in one of the upper chambers of the Golden Citadel.  The decora-
    tions of this place surpass even those of the first floor.  Gold tiles etched
    with platinum cover the floor, walls and the ceiling.  The lights from numerous
    torches reflect from these shimmering planes, giving the illusion that you are
    standing in a gem.  Stairways lead up and down, and the hall leads west.

  title: "A Top Chamber of the Golden Citadel"
  description: >-
    You are in one of the top chambers of the Golden Citadel.  The decorations
    of this room looks like a dragon's hoard.  The whole room is carved out of pure
    gold, and gems of all types glitter from the walls, ceiling, even the floor.
    It is obvious that this room was not meant for you to intrude upon.  A stair-
    case leads back down, and a doorway leads south.

  title: "The Dragon Chamber"
  description: >-
    You are in a vast chamber carved from gold and platinum.  Gems the size of
    a man's fist protrude from the walls, ceiling, and the floor, making your step
    painful.  A vast open sky-light lets fresh air come in from the top.  In the
    center of this chamber, you see a great wealth of coins, and on top of that
    pile of coins, you see a golden dragon squinting at you.  Exits lead to the
    cardinal directions to the anterooms.

    You are above the Dragon Chamber.  You curiously note that this shaft that

    currently, the way out is sealed by a layer of diamond that looks impenetrable.
