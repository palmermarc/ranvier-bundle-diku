  syntax: q <item> short <new short name>
  q <short name> long <new long name>
  
  When an avatar reaches status 5 <fighter> he/she/it gains the ability
  to 'rename' their eq. This costs 1 qp to do both the short and
  long descriptions.
  
  The short desc is what you see when you type inventory or eq. The long
  desc is what you see if it is on the ground.
  
  Clan EQ cannot be renamed.
  
  ***DO NOT RENAME SOULBLADES** (Is buggy)
