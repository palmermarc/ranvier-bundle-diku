  KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something. BACKSTAB is another way
  to start a fight. BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.
  
  BERSERK will make you strike out at every creature in the room. It will 
  hit players as well as mobiles, so it's a good idea not to use this skill 
  while you are grouped.
  DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent. Similarly,
  KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.
  PUNCH will inflict a small amount of damage, and stun your opponent for a 
  short period of time. It also has a chance of breaking your opponents 
  nose or jaw.
  
  In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, KICK or PUNCH successfully, you must practice
  the appropriate skill.
