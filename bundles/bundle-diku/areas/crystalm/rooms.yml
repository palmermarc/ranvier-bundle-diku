    >From this rock outcropping the valley below seems peaceful, untouched.
    Dense forests of pine carpet the mountainsides, broken only by thick aspen 
    woods. The mountains, deep blue in the distance, circle the valley floor and 
    form a soft highland bowl.
    There is a sign nailed to a nearby tree.
