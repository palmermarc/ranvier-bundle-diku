body: |
  When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
  of Midgaard. Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
  together with all of your equipment and gold.
  
  Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.
  
  Following and groups are not affected by death.
  
  You lose experience points for dying. The amount you lose is ALL of your 
  current amount, so it's a good idea not to hoard exp.
  
  You also lose 1 random immunity (unless you're a vampire, then
  you lose heat ;> ), and 1 of each attribute (str/int/wis/con/dex).
  
  Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
  Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).
