  description: >-
    You have found Merlin's tower. It is a jumbled mess of books, scrolls, 
    wands, staves, etc. There are rickety worn out tables and chairs upon 
    which a variety of curiosities rest. Merlin also has several animals 
    and specimens of this and that in crocks on wooden shelves. You take a 
    glimpse out the open window of Merlin's tower and see the rolling hills 
    of Camelot as far as you gaze. But most of all you notice the large 
    pulsating pentagram in the center of the room which throbs and humms 
    in time to your heartbeat. There is also a SIGN here with unearthly 
    glowing red lettering which blinks over and over the message "LOOK AT ME"
