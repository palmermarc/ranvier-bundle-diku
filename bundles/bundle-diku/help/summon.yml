  Syntax: cast summon <character>
  Syntax: Summon <on> or <off>
  
  This spell summons a character from anywhere else in your zone into your room.
  Characters who are fighting may not be summoned.
  
  A player may type: summon <off> to prevent other players from being able to 
  summon him or her. This 'immunity' to being summon has a failure rate 5% of
  the time. So remember that you are never truly safe from being summoned.
  
  NOTE: A player CAN be summoned from his/her clanroom.
