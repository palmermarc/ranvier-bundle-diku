  title: "Entrance to the Mob Factory"
  description: >-
    You find that you have entered a strange factory. This factory doesn't
    make cars or computers or something - it makes mobs! The sound of
    machinery can be heard in the background; the grinding gears drive you
    crazy! To the north you see the storage area, to the south the
    foreman's office, to the east the entrance hallway, and to the west the
    eastern end of alley.

    This is where the raw materials from which mobs are manufactured are
    stored. You see sacks of sawdust, cans of pink paint, a large box
    containing wigs and a bottle mysteriously labelled "solution x". Exits
    are more of storage to the east and north, and entrance to the mob
    factory to the south.

    This is the place where the foreman makes frequent visits. The smell
    here is very strong and reminds you of bovine excrement! There is a
    shower to the back, and a urinal to the left. On the floor you can
    see stains of a very suspicious nature. The only exit leads north to
