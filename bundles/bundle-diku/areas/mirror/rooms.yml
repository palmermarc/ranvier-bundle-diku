  title: "The croquet lawn"
  description: >-
    You are standing on a immaculately manicured green lawn, the kind you only
    get after 200 years of meticulous work. There is a winding stone path leading
    from the wood's edge to the north, to the softly shimmering, rainbow-colored
    dome covering construction to the south. This place enjoys a perpetual cool,
    sunny summers after-noon.

  title: "The Void"
  description: >-
    You are standing in the middle of something you cannot explain.  You see
    stars yet you cannot see what you are standing on.  You are not standing
    on any sort of physical 'ground' as you can see yet you are not floating
    either.  Occasionally, the starry 'sky' fades into a fuzzy, yet bright,
    rainbow then back to its normal state.  In the middle of this room is
    a ladder standing vertical.

  title: "The Temple Of Midgaard"
  description: >-
    You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Midgaard.
    The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
    appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
    picturing Gods, Giants and peasants.
       Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
    mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
       You notice that this building is quite new.  A small plaque is on this wall.

  description: >-
    You are standing on the temple square.  Huge marble steps lead up to the
    temple gate.  The ground is just dirt but there are plans to make the road

    center of Midgaard.
