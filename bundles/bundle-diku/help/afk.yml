  A player who is AFK is 'Away From Keyboard.'
  A player who is AFK does not have control of his/her character and 
  can make no response to anything that occurs to his/her character.
  
  On a PK mud like this, however, afk can also mean 'A Free KILL.' So, 
  don't whine when you go afk and come back to find your self decapped, 
  staked, torsoed, or all of the above.
