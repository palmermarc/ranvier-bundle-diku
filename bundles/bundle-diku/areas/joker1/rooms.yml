  title: "Mouth of the river"
  description: >-
    You are at the mouth of the river, away from the delta swamp and breathing
    in fresh air again! The open sea lies to your west, or the way back home
    lays to the east. Still you cannot decide the exact reason for the two 
    towers, yet they seem strangly empty. Who knows, someday someone will
    fill them again.....what a frightening thought!

    You are north of the fork, and you see a huge tower to the west. 
    You wonder what reason such a structure could be built.
