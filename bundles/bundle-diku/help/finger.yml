  The FINGER command allows you gather information about
  players that are online while you are on the mud.
  
  To FINGER a player, you must be able to see them, so make
  sure you have the 'detect invisible' and 'detect hidden' 
  spells.
  
  When you FINGER a GOD/ADMIN, they are notified, so do not SPAM them with 
  FINGER, or you will pay the price.
