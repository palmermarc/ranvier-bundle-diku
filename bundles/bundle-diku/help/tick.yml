  Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
  most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
  weather, and area resetting.
  
  Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
  'tick'. Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
  amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
  
  Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
  often (15 minutes) if some one is. Also note that objects lying on the ground
  will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
