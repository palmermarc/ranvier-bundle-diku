  Syntax: PRACTICE (skill|spell>
  Syntax: PRACTICE # <skill|spell>
  
  PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability in all the 
  skills and spells available to you. You can check this anywhere.
  
  PRACTICE with an argument practices that skill or spell. Your learning
  percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum of 100%. You can 
  practice anywhere.
  
  You can also type: practice # <skill|spell> so you can practice multiple
  times. If you type: practice 14 <skill|spell> - you will max out the
  spell or skill.
  
  The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice.
  
  Because the PRACTICE screen is so large, it is split up into two screens - type
  PRAC1 and PRAC2 to see these two screens seperately.
