  title: "Outside Redferne's residence "
  description: >-
    A huge cloud forms the plateau on which you are now standing. The wind here
    is absolutely quiet and the sun is shining warmly upon you. From under the
    cloud you can hear the faint sounds of Midgaard. Right before you to the
    north lies the grand Mansion of Naris, the residence of the Greater God
    Redferne.

  title: "The Southern end of the hall"
  description: >-
    You are standing in a vast hall that is dimly lit, but wherefrom the
    light comes, is a mystery. The walls seem to radiate warmth and give
    the pleasant feeling of being welcome here. A large portrait is hanging
    on one of the walls. A large wooden staircase leads up into the tower.
    To the east there is a high passage away from the hall. This ends
    shortly after by a tall oak door. The enormous hall extends further
    north from here. To the south you can see a huge, and VERY heavy-
    looking iron-wrought door. It looks like this is the only exit from
    this magnificent old house. To the west you can see a large ashen door.

  title: "Redferne's Library"
  description: >-
    This is truly a magnificent place! Books and scrolls lie together on every
    shelf. A large globe, with the map of the Mud-world upon it, stands in the
    dimly lit north-western corner of the room. Two large and comfortable-
    looking leather arm-chairs adorn the center of the library together with
    a huge oak desk. Dim light radiates from an enormous crystal chandelier
    hanging down from the ceiling approximately 10 feet off the floor. To the
    east there is a great old ashen door. A large glass window is set in the
    west wall.

  title: "The Artifact room of Naris"
  description: >-
    This is gloomy and dark room with only a faint light radiating from the
    walls. A bunch of funny-looking items fill the center of the room. There are
    no furniture here what-so-ever. The only way out seems to be west, through
    the low steel door.

  title: "The Northern end of the hall"
  description: >-
    You are standing in the northern end of the huge hall. This part is under
    the grand wooden staircase so the light seems a little less bright here,
    but this doesn't bother your sight at all. To the north lies the kitchen.
    To the south lies the Southern end of the hall. To the east there is a huge
    metal door. To the west there is a large aspenwood door.

  title: "The Sitting room of Naris"
  description: >-
    You are standing in the middle of a really comfortable place. The walls are
    decorated with paintings of smiling Kings and Queens. The most attractive
    picture is one of a Prince in shiny armour. By one of the walls there is an
    old arm-chair. The only exit is through the aspenwood door to the east.

  title: "The Kitchen of Naris"
  description: >-
    This must be the place of food and drink. You can hear the faint noise of 
    rats feasting on meat and bread from somewhere undeterminable. The sound
    makes you feel the agony of HUNGER. The only visible exit is south to the
    Northern end of the hall. To the north there is a larder, and to the east
    stands a fridge.

  title: "On the stairs"
  description: >-
    You can see up and down the stairway. It seems to take forever, either going
    up OR down. It's just a seemingly insurmountable climb, either way. Up is the 
    bedroom of Redferne, and Down leads to the Southern end of the hall.

  title: "Redferne's Bedroom"
  description: >-
    This is a snugly set bedroom with all the necessities for a romantic evening.
    A large fireplace adorns the east wall, and sizzling away is the wood that
    is ablaze within.  The bed is enormous, covering at least HALF of this great
    room.  This stretches at least 300 square feet, so can you imagine the BED?
    A large staircase leads down to the hall.  A couple of doors open up to a
    broad balcony to the south.

  description: >-
    You see a splendid of the most of this world. The valleys stretch as far as
    the eye reaches to the south from here. Down below you can see the entrance
    of this magnificent building. To the north are the doors to Redferne's Bedroom.

  title: "The Monster Pen"
  description: >-
    This looks like the cage in which a large carnivore is being kept. Judging by
    the state the walls are in, this could very well be a large AGGRESSIVE animal. 
    This makes you pretty insecure, this stating your feeling about the place, 
    quite mildly.

  title: "On the Huge Chain"
  description: >-
    This place has quite a good view over Midgaard. Your possibilities of movement
    seems to extend only to up and down. Unless you want to let go of the secure
    and seemingly unmoveable chain, then those are the directions you should take
    from here.

  title: "On the Great Chain of Naris"
  description: >-
    You are approximately on the middle of the treacherous Chain. One false step
    and death will come and collect you quickly. The chain leads upwards and down.
    No way are you going to descend now ... you've only just begun your climb.
    Besides it could cost you your life.  Look down and you'll see why.

    This place offers a splendid view of the WHOLE COUNTRY SIDE!!! A magnificent
    light shines upon you and the way up through the clouds is opened. Up there
    you can now see the Mansion of Naris, Residence of the Greater God Redferne.
    The chain beneath you seems to evaporate in the mustering clouds that
    surround you by now.
