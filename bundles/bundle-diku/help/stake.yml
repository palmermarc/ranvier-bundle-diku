  Syntax: stake <character>
  
  To stake a vampire, you must be holding a stake in your hand. Once staked, a
  vampire loses all it's powers and is no longer a member of the clan or even a
  vampire anymore. Finding stakes is hard to do, as players were changing clans
  very often, which is not something that they should be able to do. Therefore
  stakes have been taken out of the game in most places, so the only way to find
  one is to get one created using quest points, or use another stake. Once used, a
  stake cannot be re-used.
  
  You cannot stake a vampire in human form, or one who has used the darkheart
  discipline to tear out their own heart.
