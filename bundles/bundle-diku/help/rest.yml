  Syntax: wake
  
  These commands change your position. When you REST or SLEEP, you 
  regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
  However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
  you won't hear many things happen.
  
  Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position. You can
  also WAKE other sleeping characters.
  
  For info on the sleep spell, type: 'help sleepspell'.
