  CLAIM:
  You can claim your equipment while it in your inventory for a small cost
  of 5000 exp per item. When you have claimed your items you can then use
  quest points to improve the equipment and also you can then use CALL on it.
  
  CALL:
  Call simply summons the equipment back to your inventory no matter where 
  it is, even if someone else is using or wearing it. Call all calls all items,
  whereas call <item> calls a specific item.
  
  GIFT:
  If you have CLAIMED an item, then you can GIFT it to another player. The item
  must be in your inventory, and the player must be visible in the same room as
  you. It enables them to use CALL on that item, as if they had CLAIMED it.
  NOTE: You can't gift Indestructable or Autoclaim EQ.
