  FASTDRAW is automatic, if you have it. If another player attacks you 
  while you have any sheathed weapons, you will draw them out with 
  lightning speed and strike your opponent before they are able to land any 
  blows on you. If you have any items in your hands at the time, you will 
  throw them aside before drawing your weapons.
