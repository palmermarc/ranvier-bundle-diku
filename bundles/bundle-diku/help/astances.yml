  Advanced stances are a combination of two other basic stances - To use them, you
  must be Grand Master in two basic stances, although you have to find out which
  ones yourself! The types of stances are these :
  
  swallow - Quick and agile, this stance keeps you moving, and is the
  ultimate defensive stance.
  cobra - A well rounded stance, combining speed of offense with a
  solid defense.
  panther - Fast, and agile, leaping attacks that provide defence and rain
  constant blows down on your opponant 
  lion - A solid stance, that sacrifices defence for an all out offensive
  assault.
  grizzlie - A nasty combination of solid defence, with attacks of raw power
  make this a stance to be feared.
  falcon - Just like the falcon, this stance is agile, and yet able to
  make powerful, punishing attacks.
