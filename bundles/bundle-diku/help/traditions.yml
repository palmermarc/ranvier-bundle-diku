  The First Tradition: The Masquerade
  Thou shall not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood.
  Doing such shall renounce thy claims of Blood.
  The Second Tradition: The Domain
  Thy domain is thine own concern. All others owe thee respect
  while in it. None may challenge thy word while in thy domain.
  The Third Tradition: The Progeny
  Thou shall only Sire another with the permission of thine elder
  If thou createst another without thine Elder's leave, both thou 
  and thy Progeny shall be slain.
  The Fourth Tradition: The Accounting
  Those thou create are thine own children. Until thy Progeny 
  shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things.
  Their sins are thine to endure.
  The Fifth Tradition: Hospitality
  Honour on another's domain. When thou comest to a foreign city
  city, thou shall present thyself to the one who ruleth there. Without
  the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.
  The Sixth Tradition: Destruction
  Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind. The right of
  destruction belongeth only to thine Elder. Only the Eldest amoung
  thee shall call the Blood Hunt.
