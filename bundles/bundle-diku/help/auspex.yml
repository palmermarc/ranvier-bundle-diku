  Auspex is as much reflections of the Curse of Caine as the traditional banes, as it can lead to an obsession with minutiae and distraction from important matters from focusing on minor details. Also, higher mastery of the discipline can result in Cainites who are accustomed to using Auspex to read the minds of people in any situation and may suddenly find themselves unable to shut the mind-reading down. These vampires find themselves overwhelmed with "background noise" or, if only in the company of one or two people, answering unasked questions.
