  A BUG <not to be confused with the BUG command> is an undesired feature of 
  the code. BUGS can often be abused for personal gain, giving a player an 
  unfair advantage. Abuse of BUGS can lead to serious punishment, including 
  deletion. If you find something you think is a bug, report it immediately.
  Remember that reporting it does not give you the right to abuse it until it
  is fixed.
  
  A LOOPHOLE is a way around limitations put in place by the code, or 
  rules/laws put in place by the coders. Players that purposefully seek out
  ways to find a way around these limitations, especially new ones put in 
  place specifically to solve a bug/problem, really piss the admin off. Don't
  do this. Players should try to beat other players, not the code.
