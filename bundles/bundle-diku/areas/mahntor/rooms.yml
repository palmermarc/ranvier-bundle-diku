  description: >-
    You are travelling through woods that are as dark as night. The trees above
    block all light and wind. The air is stagnant and smells of death and decay.
    The lack of sounds and other signs of life make your skin crawl and you feel
    very much like turning back and heading for safer areas. The path leads north
    into more open lands while it also leads south into the darkness of the forest.
    A small sign is posted here.

  description: >-
    You wearily travel through the darkness of the forest. Huge skeletal trees
    line the edges of the path and tower above you. Errant rays of light spear
    down through the gaps in the canopy above and provide small spots of light
    that seem to attract what little foliage can grow on the dark forest floor.
    The path winds north and south into darkness.

    The forest path splits here in three directions. Small paths lead to the east,
    north, and south. The trees above leave a gap which allows light to fill the
    intersection. It is almost as though you are in a circle of light that
    provides sanctuary in this land of darkness.
